simple cell:
	This idea was taken from a Tsoing video where he tries to implement something like Excel but very very
	much simpler, and then i try to implement what he did.

	The program just needs a file which must contain a table that gotta looks like:
	| value | value | value
	| value | value
	       ...
	| value | value | value
	| value | value

	The separator between cells is '|' symbol and it cannot be skiped since all table
	will be just only one cell with a lot of tokens.

	The program is able to perform copy value from another cells without entering into a loop
	and do arithmetic.

	Errors:
	There's only one error which will stop the program at all, it's when trying to get a cell
	but it's outta table's range, the others are:
	* number_def!
	* copies_def!
	* loop_copying!
	* empty_expression!
	* number_ref!
	* operator_ref!
	* divby_zero!
